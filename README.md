My project is a app where you can see the products that your profile has sold in amazon. Having said that, the profile, the products and the buyers are all fictitious.
My app consits of the start screen, after you click on login you go to the login page. The username and the password can be invented, but they can´t be in blanc. 
After that there is the menu page and there you can chose on going to your profile, the products or amazon.
In the profile you can change the theme of the app, see your username, password and the valoration of you profile.
In products you can see a list of all your products or you can search one specifically. Then if you click of one product you go to the detail page where you can see an image, the price, the buyer and more information of the buyer. Plus oyu can rate them.
if you click the amazon button you go to the amazon web. But if your emulator doesn´t have google chrome or it can´t use it, an error messages will show up.

For running the project all you have to do is open it with android studio and running the project. Make sure that you have a configured emulator and that you are inside the app folder.
After that a window with a mobile phone should appear and you will be able to use it.
